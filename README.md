# ðŸš€ ChurnShield â€“ My Unique Approach to Retaining SyriaTel Customers

**Personal Vision**  
This project is my personal take on solving a real-world telecom challenge. With ChurnShield, I applied my analytical skills to predict customer churn at SyriaTel using data science. The result? A model that doesnâ€™t just crunch numbersâ€”it helps people make better business decisions.
